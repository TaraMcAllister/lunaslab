<h1 class="elementh1">What is an Element?</h1>

<section class="mainpara">

        <section class="mainfacts">
        <p>To understand what an element is we first must understand what atoms are. Atoms are tiny particles that are far too small to see, even with a microscope. They are the smallest thing in the universe. They are tiny balls that make up <u>everything</u> in the universe.</p>
        <p>Elements are made up of atoms. All the atoms in an element are exactly the same type of atom. For example in the element Oxgyen, there are only Oxygen atoms. That is what makes elements so important in our world.</p>
        <p>Some elements are found within nature and we, humans, just happened to stumble upon them. We didn't understand elements for a long period of history. Other elements are created by scientists in experiments in labs!</p>
        <p>Each element is given its own chemical symbol, like H for hydrogen or O for oxygen. Chemical symbols are usually one or two letters long. Every chemical symbol starts with a capital letter, with the second letter written in lower case.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is easy to tell which element a symbol stands for. For example, C stands for carbon and Li stands for lithium.</p>
        <p>But sometimes the symbol comes from a name for the element that is not an English word. For example, W stands for tungsten (from the word wolfram - a Swedish word) and Na stands for sodium (from the word natrium - a Latin word).</p>
        <p>The same chemical symbols are used all over the world, no matter which language is spoken, which makes them very useful.</p>
        <p>All the elements are in the Periodic Table which has been developed over hundreds of years. Here you can see the elements symbol, it's atomic number and it's atomic mass. The elements are arranged in groups within the table. Groups usually have similar properties.</p>
